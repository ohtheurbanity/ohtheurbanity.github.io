            If you’ve been following the national news recently, you might have seen that an Arkansas state legislature panel after taking control of the Little Rock School District (LRSD) a few years ago, almost returned the control of schools back to locals only in the mostly white and wealthy northern and western parts of Little Rock. This planned move was criticized as an attempt at modern segregation, drawing both local and national outrage. Thankfully, due to local opposition and national news coverage, the state panel backed down from its plan. It has now agreed to share control of the LRSD with the city government.  However, the state panel is now trying to break up the Little Rock Education Association (LREA) union - the last teacher union in Arkansas.  It recently voted to strip the LREA of its collective bargaining power.  As I write this, the Little Rock Education Association is planning to go on strike in response to the vote. 
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-primary"><em>How did the Little Rock School District reach this breaking point?</em></h5>
            <p>The complete answer to that question is more complex than I have time to go into and longer than you likely have time to read but a few things should be briefly mentioned before we continue:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                Arkansas has an accountability system that uses the results of students’ standardized testing to assign a grade from “A” to “F” to each school.
                </li>
                <li>
                Much of the rhetoric coming from the state panel that took over control of the Little Rock School District implicitly and explicitly places the blame on teachers of the LRSD for the “F” ratings of many of its schools.
                </li>
                <li>
                This rhetoric stands in contrast to what has been found by numerous studies - that the socioeconomic background of the students of a school has a large effect on school performance. These are just a few of the papers I found from a quick search:

                Many wealthier, often white, parents choose to send their students to private or charter schools in Little Rock, changing <a href = https://www.lrsd.org/cms/lib/AR02203631/Centricity/Domain/257/2018-LRSD-COMMUNITY-REPORT.pdf>the demographics of the students in the Little Rock School District (page 13)</a> in relation to <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Rock,_Arkansas#Demographics>Little Rock's demographics as a whole.</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                For a long time Little Rock’s public schools took mostly students that came from neighborhoods surrounding the schools, although this has changed recently. Many of the schools that received an “F” from the state government were located south of I-630. 
                </li>
                
            </ol>
            <p class = "mb-3"> <strong>The takeway</strong> - School performance and student achievement do not exist in isolation from the demographic and socioeconomic context of the students that attend the school. Little Rock’s public school student demographics and socioeconomic backgrounds are significantly different from the city as a whole. 
            </p>
            <h5 class = "text-primary"><em>Thus, one might wonder, what is the demographic and socioeconomic make-up of Little Rock's neighborhoods and how has this changed over time?</em></h5>
            <p>
            To answer this question, I used a dataset called the longitudinal tract database to get demographic and socioeconomic data from census tracts located in Little Rock going back to 1970.  Then, I aggregated 2010 census tracts based on their location relative to interstate highways that run around and through Little Rock.  Little Rock’s downtown core, located around the area known as the River Market, was not a prominent residential area until very recently so I decided to exclude the census tract containing it.</p>

            </div>
            <p>
            Since 1970, the area of western Little Rock, shown above, has experienced rapid residential development. The residential development has mostly been focused on single-family residential homes, as you can see from this <a href = "https://maps.littlerock.state.ar.us/webapps/LR_Land_Use_Viewer" target="_blank">zoning map of Little Rock</a>. Below is a graph of population over time in Little Rock for each area. West Little Rock is the only area to experience sustained population growth during the past 40 years:

            </div>
            <p>
            Most of the growth in West Little Rock has been driven primarily by white families. Because previous censuses counted Asian-Americans in inconsistent ways, I excluded them from these calculations. Latinx populations only started to be counted (as their own group) in the census in 1980. Below are graphs of black, white, and latinx populations in each area over time:

            </div>
            <p>
            In Northern Little Rock, whites have always been the largest racial group.

            </div>
            <p>
            The most dramatic population demographic changes have been in South Little Rock. In 1970, whites made up 68 percent of the population and blacks made up 30 percent. In 2010, whites made up 19 percent of the population and blacks made up 71 percent.
            </p>
            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3">

            </div>
            <p>
            If we were blind to the racial and economic history of this country, these demographic changes might not matter. But knowing that latinx, black, and white Americans have historically had, <i>on average,</i> different socioeconomic advantages and disadvantages, I also calculated median household income for each area. To do so, I took an average for each census tract, weighted that by the number of households in that tract, and then summed those weighted numbers over the area.  Over time, the median household income (adjusted to 2010 dollars) for western Little Rock and northern Little Rock have increased, while southern Little Rock has decreased.

            Alright, time for a quick break from Little Rock to talk about...dun dun dun….research. If you’ve read this far, just stick with me, I promise I’ll get back to interactive graphs and charts in a second. Lincoln Quillian, a professor at Northwestern University,
            <a href = "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0003122412447793" target = "_blank">provides an important model to think about segregation and poverty.</a> Modifying an earlier theory, he posits three reasons for concentrated poverty: racial segregation, poverty-status segregation within race, and segregation from high and middle-income members of other racial groups.  I believe that racial segregation and segregation from high and middle-income members of other racial groups has gotten worse in southern Little Rock from 1970 to 2010, which results in this graph:

            </div>
            <p>
            Southern Little Rock has remained continuously poorer and become more segregated than northern Little Rock and western Little Rock, both of which have actually become more integrated.  Southern Little Rock became more segregated through the <a href = "https://arktimes.com/news/cover-stories/2011/01/26/wilbur-mills-wall" target = "_blank">building of I-630</a>, which provides both a mental and physical wall between poorer southern Little Rock and the rest of Little Rock, the <a href = "https://arktimes.com/news/cover-stories/2014/07/10/the-roots-of-little-rocks-segregated-neighborhoods" target = "_blank">actions of the Little Rock Housing Authority</a>, and the relatively easy availability of home loans for whites in western Little Rock from the <a href = "https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america" target="_blank">Federal Housing Administration during a large part of the 20th century.</a>
            </p>
            <h5 class = "text-primary"><em>What are the effects of growing up in each area of Little Rock on household income later in life?</em></h5>
            <p>
            Using data from the <a href = "https://www.opportunityatlas.org/" target="_blank">Opportunity Atlas</a>, which is, from their website, “the result of a collaboration between researchers at the Census Bureau and Opportunity Insights (a research and policy group based at Harvard University)” that estimates relationships between parental income when the children were growing up and each outcome proportionally based on the amount of time spent growing up in a census tract area, I compared outcomes for children born in each area. For example, if you grew up in western Little Rock, averaging out all differences in race and class, your household income is likely around $56774. On the other hand, given the same conditions, if you grew up in southern Little Rock, your household income is likely around $24844. Graph below:

            </div>
            <p>
            This disparity in current household income holds if you are black and grew up in each area:

            </div>
            <p>
            It also holds if you are black and your parents were in the 50th percentile of income:

            </div>
            <h5 class = "text-primary"><em>THE BIG TAKEAWAY</em></h5>

            <ol>
                <li>
                Southern Little Rock became more segregated over the past 40 years, which contributed to a concentration of poverty in that area, in part due to the development of western Little Rock.
                </li>
                <li>
                Student achievement and thus school achievement for public schools in southern Little Rock suffered as a result of the increase in segregation, concentrated poverty, and the option for parents to send kids to charter and private schools instead of public schools.
                </li>
                <li>
                These historical trends are not the fault of teachers from the Little Rock School District. Although teachers and schools should generally be held accountable, the blame for the “failure” of some of the schools in the Little Rock School District should not rest solely on teachers in light of the information above.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
            Unfortunately, the “opportunity gap” is unlikely to go away anytime soon. Primary and secondary school education does not operate in isolation from the social, economic, and spatial contexts in which both the students and teachers exist.  It isn’t just a matter of more funding or better teachers that is needed to close the gap.  If Little Rock truly wants to level the playing field, it needs to pursue policies that support community and economic development in southern Little Rock and address the consequences of misguided development policies which have, consciously or not, mostly benefited communities in western Little Rock. Busing kids halfway across the city helps public school achievement but it won’t fix other issues affecting students in Little Rock. Little Rock also needs to reckon with charter and private schools draining well-resourced students from public schools. How that should be accomplished, unlike the previous state control of the Little Rock School District, should be up to the citizens of the city.
            </p>
